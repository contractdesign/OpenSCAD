# README

This repository contains OpenSCAD files I have created for various
projects, along with the resultant STL files.
[OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org) is an open-source tool that lets one
programmatically create 3D files (STL, etc.) that can be 3D printed.

## References
- The OpenSCAD [Cheatsheet](http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/) is a
  helpful reference to have available while coding.
- [SolidPython](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython) is a helpful
  library that allows coding in Python and exporting to OpenSCAD.
  Recent versions of OpenSCAD have greatly improved the language,
  making using Python less necessary.
